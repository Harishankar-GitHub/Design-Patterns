public class Main {

//     Decorator - It is a design pattern categorized in structural pattern. It helps to decorate the object.
//     It basically keeps expanding behaviour of the object.The decorator design pattern is used to change an objectâ€™s functionality during runtime.
//     Other instances of the same class will be unaffected, therefore each object will have its behavior changed.

//     Since we can keep supporting adding new decorator we are getting dynamic object extension.
//     After all we are creating stack of wrapper , certain system becomes so coupled that it becomes difficult to
//     remove certain decorators.

//     Inheritance also helps to expand the functionality but that is at compile time not at runtime.
//     One of the best example of decorator is customized pizza. Where you have pizza, and you have different decorator
//     like add extra cheese, cheese burst, olives, jalapeno. We keep adding toppings and we finally get pizza.

//     You can also think of Account -> Saving Account -> Salary Account -> Preferred Account.
//     Where base is Account. Now based on different account type it keeps adding new features and offers to same account.

//     To achieve decorator pattern you need following:
//     Create Interface - Base product
//     Create abstract class - Base product's base impl
//     Abstract Decorator - which implements base product - This works as foundation of decorator what other decorator needs to do minimum.
//     Different decorators - Which takes this product input and decorate it.

//     Java example : Collection.unmodifiableMap - this is decorator which is extending Map's functionality and
//     making unmodifiable.
